    Singleton Design Pattern
    + define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
    + Two forms:
        - Early Instantiation: create at load time
        - Lazy Instantiation: create when required
    + Advantages
        - save memory
        - easy to use
    + Mostly used in multi-thread and database application
    + private static member, private constructor, static factory method name: getInstance()

    Factory Design Pattern
    + Creational design pattern: Instantiates Obj
    + Provide an interface for creating obj and allows to decide which class to instantiate
